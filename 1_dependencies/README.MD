# The Arcade Arcade

Welcome to the arcade! ...of arcades!

## Requirements

This release requires the US-version of Super Mario Bros. 1 and Contra and Nestopia v1.37.  
Copy the ROM-files with a `.nes` ending into `platforms/NES/games`; named just like the .JSON-files already placed there.  
Download Nestopia v1.37, create the folder `platforms/NES/executable` and extract the .zip-file into it. (So that nestopia.exe is located at `platforms/NES/executable/nestopia.exe`.)

## Playing

1. Start `thearcadearcade.exe`
2. Collect 20 coins in Super Mario Bros. 1
3. Kill 10 enemies / (destroy turrets / collect items for bonus points) in Contra
4. Notice the score in the Pop-Up (which might actually be a pop-under)
5. That's... that's about it for now. Sorry 'bout that.
